# Performance Evaluation of vectorization using the simulation-of-Conway's-game-of-life
This project is an implementation of Conwayâ€™s game of life. The simulation consists of a grid, each grid is referred to as a cell. The simulation moves forward in discrete time steps, at each time step, a cell is marked as either alive or dead according to the following rules:
- If the cell is alive, then it stays alive if it has either 2 or 3 live neighbors
- If the cell is dead, then it springs to life only in the case that it has 3 live neighbors.
<br />
The simulation is developed using python OOP and evaluated the performance effect of vectorizations.
