# Simulation-of-Conway's-game-of-life
This project is an implementation of Conway’s game of life. The simulation consists of a grid, each grid is referred to as a cell. The simulation moves forward in discrete time steps, at each time step, a cell is marked as either alive or dead according to the following rules:
• If the cell is alive, then it stays alive if it has either 2 or 3 live neighbors
• If the cell is dead, then it springs to life only in the case that it has 3 live neighbors.
Here I use python’s object oriented concept also vectorization.
